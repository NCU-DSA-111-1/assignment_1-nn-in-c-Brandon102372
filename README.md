# How to use the program:
1. Enter the number of input bits
2. Enter training epoch
3. The program will show training progress and accuracy of 5  epoch
```
epoch     train_accuracy     test_accuracy     total_accuracy
    0           0.541667          0.375000           0.500000

19999/20000(100.0%)
```
* train_accuracy: accuracy of training data
* test_accuracy: accuracy of testing data
* total_accuracy: accuracy of all data 
4. After the training, user can input datas to test the result (string type)
5. If enter 2, the progrom will end
6. Call graph.py if you want to draw the learning process of neural network
